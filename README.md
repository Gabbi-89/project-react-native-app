# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project was about to create a mobile App with React Native and by using Styled Components. My App is a multiscreen App made with React Navigation. The App's functionality is to choose the workout for the day. 

## The problem

The hardest problem was to decide what to do and to understand what would be possible to do in the time frame of a week. 

I didn't really had a proper plan, I just tried to test different things so see what even were possible. My plan was to create an easy App and if time add features upon it and try out the styling. 

I started with doing an array with workout forms and a button that randomized the workout for the day. I made this with a 'onPress' event.

After that I added another page to make it a multiscreen App with React Navigation. I learned how to use 'setOptions()' to remove the navigation bar that appeared and finally I added a Button that navigated back to the first page.
